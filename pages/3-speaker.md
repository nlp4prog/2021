**Talk**: _TBD_

**Bio**:
Percy Liang is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Stanford University (B.S. from MIT, 2004; Ph.D. from UC Berkeley, 2011). Percy was also the lead scientist at Semantic Machines and now works at Microsoft part-time on conversational AI. His two research goals are (i) to make machine learning more robust, fair, and interpretable; and (ii) to make computers easier to communicate with through natural language.

His awards include the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (2019), IJCAI Computers and Thought Award (2016), an NSF CAREER Award (2016), a Sloan Research Fellowship (2015), and a Microsoft Research Faculty Fellowship (2014).

**Talk**: _TBD_

**Bio**:
Lin Tan is a Mary J. Elmore New Frontiers Associate Professor of Computer Science at Purdue University. She is an IEEE senior member.

She received her PhD from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. Prior to joining Purdue, she was a Canada Research Chair and an associate professor at the University of Waterloo. Her research interests include software dependability and software text analytics. Some of her research focuses are leveraging machine learning and natural language processing techniques to improve software dependability, and using software approaches to improve the dependability of machine learning systems.

Dr. Tan was a recipient of Canada Research Chair (one of Canada's highest research honors), an NSERC Discovery Accelerator Supplements Award, an Ontario Early Researcher Award, an Ontario Professional Engineers Award--Engineering Medal for Young Engineer, J.P.Morgan AI Research Faculty Award, two Google Faculty Research Awards, two Facebook research awards, and an IBM CAS Research Project of the Year Award. Dr. Tan's co-authored papers have received ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Awards at ASE 2020, MSR 2018, and FSE 2016; and IEEE Micro's Top Picks in 2006.

She is/was the program (co-)chair of FSE 2020 Visions & Reflections, ICSE-SMeW 2019, SOSP 2019 Scholarship, MSR 2017, ICSE-NIER 2017, and ICSME-ERA 2015. She is an associate editor of IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering (2017-present) and an editor of the Springer Empirical Software Engineering Journal (2015-present).

**Talk**: _TBD_

**Bio**:
Brad A. Myers is a Professor in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. He was chosen to receive the ACM SIGCHI Lifetime Achievement Award in Research in 2017, for outstanding fundamental and influential research contributions to the study of human-computer interaction. He is an IEEE Fellow, ACM Fellow, member of the CHI Academy, and winner of 16 Best Paper type awards and 5 Most Influential Paper Awards. He is the author or editor of over 525 publications, including the books "Creating User Interfaces by Demonstration" and "Languages for Developing User Interfaces," and he has been on the editorial board of six journals. He has been a consultant on user interface design and implementation to over 90 companies, and regularly teaches courses on user interface design and software. Myers received a PhD in computer science at the University of Toronto where he developed the Peridot user interface tool. He received the MS and BSc degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology during which time he was a research intern at Xerox PARC. From 1980 until 1983, he worked at PERQ Systems Corporation. His research interests include user interfaces, programming environments, programming language design, end-user software engineering (EUSE), API usability, developer experience (DevX or DX), interaction techniques, programming by example, mobile computing, and visual programming. He belongs to ACM, SIGCHI, IEEE, and the IEEE Computer Society.
